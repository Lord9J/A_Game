# Godot Tutorial / Example project: pixel-perfect Smooth camera

These are the example files for my YouTube tutorial about making a pixel-perfect smooth camera.
It will separate the viewport where the pixel-perfect game is running from the rest of the project which will use the 2D stretch-mode.

This will result in a pixel-perfect game while being able to use high-resolution UI and shaders.

The project uses the Pixel Line asset by Kenney:
